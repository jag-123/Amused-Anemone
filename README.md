Big Idea/Abstract

The first thing someone should see when they land on your site is a quick and easily understandable explanation of what your project is all about.

Background

Provide context for your project by describing the broader space in which it is situated. This section will likely draw upon your annotated bibliography. You've already collected this knowledge and shown us you understand it, now frame it for an external audience.

Implementation

What specifically did you accomplish with this project? Within the context of the problem space, enumerate the potential options and explain why you chose what you did. Describe what makes it interesting/challenging, and how you overcame those challenges. Explain your implementation and design decisions with sufficient detail for a technical audience to understand it.

Results

Provide evidence demonstrating that what you built works. Though the details will be different for each project, screenshots and video are likely helpful. Include graphs or other data if appropriate.

Clear, descriptive, unambiguous, memorable
Description
"What does it do", including some context. You can be brief here and include a link to your final report for more details

Getting Started
Installation instructions, including any required dependencies. A good approach here is to provide a list of required packages/programs, along with a helpful sudo apt-get install x y z one-liner. 
Usage
Provide brief examples of how to run the code and expected results (more in the report)
Describe any required input/output files.
License
Your project represents a fair amount of your hard work, so you should think a bit about the terms on which you want to release it into the world. Check out http://choosealicense.com (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.
