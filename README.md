# Pristine Pipes

## Description
We implemented a simple screen saver in C++ using OpenGL. Our basis for the screen saver was the [pipes screen saver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uzx9ArZ7MUU). Learn more about our project at our [project site](https://jag-123.github.io/SoftSysAmusedAnemone/).

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to have GLUT installed on your machine:

                  freeglut3-dev
                  freeglut3
                  
 To install the dependecies you need to run:

                sudo apt-get install freeglut3 freeglut3-dev libglu1-mesa libglu1-mesa-dev libgl1-mesa-glx libgl1-mesa-dev



## Usage
1. Download [this folder](https://github.com/jag-123/SoftSysAmusedAnemone/tree/master/final) called "final" and compile the program by running `make`. Then run `./pipe.o`.

2. A new screen should appear that displays one growing pipe. Once that pipe can no longer grow or reaches a size of 200 segments, a new pipe will begin to generate. Each pipe is a different color and the different pipes will not run into each other. Pipe creation will continue until 10 pipes are created.

3. There are no required input or output files.
