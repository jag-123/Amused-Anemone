## Abstract
We implemented a screen saver in C++ using OpenGL. Our basis for the screen saver was the [pipes screen saver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uzx9ArZ7MUU).  View our code [here](https://github.com/jag-123/SoftSysAmusedAnemone/Pipe).

## Goals
For this project our team was interested in implementing grpahics using OpenGL and C++. Creating a screensaver that was 3-dimensional and changed over time seemed like a perfect way to improve our skills and create something enjoyable for everyone. 

## Background
Going into this project, half of the team had not used C++ or OpenGL before and the other half had a reasonable amount of experience. Most of the background research that was done in preperation for this project consisted of online tutorials to get all of the members comfortable using OpenGL and a lot of experimentation with example code. The primary outcome of this research was knowledge of how OpenGL creates and displays objects and how it allows obejcts to change over time. We also learned a lot about how OpenGL programs tend to be structured and which functions act as the building blocks for their programs.

***Provide context for your project by describing the broader space in which it is situated. This section will likely draw upon your annotated bibliography. Youâ€™ve already collected this knowledge and shown us you understand it, now frame it for an external audience.***

## Implementation

What specifically did you accomplish with this project? Within the context of the problem space, enumerate the potential options and explain why you chose what you did. Describe what makes it interesting/challenging, and how you overcame those challenges. Explain your implementation and design decisions with sufficient detail for a technical audience to understand it.

## Results
The following video is an example of our pipes screen saver in action.
