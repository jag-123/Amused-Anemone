##Goal

###Overview
- Create a simple screensaver in C++ using OpenGL. We are planning to use the [pipe screen saver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uzx9ArZ7MUU) as the basis for the screen saver we wish to create with C++ using OpenGL. This will include creating at least one pipe that moves across the screen in at least 2-Dimensions without running into itself.

###MVP
- Create one single pipe that moves across the screen in 2-dimensions without running into itself.

###Stretch
- Have multiple pipes that move around the screen in 3-dimensions without running into each other. The first step will be to create the pipes at different start times and after that we will try to create multiple pipes at once.

##Resources - Annotated Bibliography
- Opengl tutorials for beginners. WIll be helpful for understanding the intricacies of OpenGL. These will first be used for comprehending graphics tutorials and later, once we understand enough concepts they will be helpful for our own implementation:

- Learning C++ (for Jeremy and Emma). Though Carl and Cleophas know a fair amount of C++, Jeremy and Emma are coming in as beginners. These resources will primarily be used for getting them up to speed with the rest:

##Tasks - Trello Board

- Trello Board - https://trello.com/b/KTYQjMuP/softsys17-amused-anemone

- Our planned tasks for the first sprint follow the order of:
 - Learn C++
 - Learn OpenGL
 - Create a single pipe
 - Build the pipe across the screen
 - Build the pipe in 2-dimensions
 - Work on preventing collisions with the pipe

##Possible Roadblocks

- Learning C++ and OpenGL well enough to understand what we are doing (Emma and Jeremy). We plan to work in mixed pairs (people who know C++ with people who do not) at the beginning of the project to account for this.

- Though we do not have a lot of experience with graphics, there seems to be a lot of information and tutorials online to help us acquire knowledge and answer questions when needed
